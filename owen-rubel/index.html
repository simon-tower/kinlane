<h1>Owen Rubel</h1>
<p>If you are reading I am guessing that Owen has posted in your LinkedIn thread, on a Github Issue, or responded to you on Twitter via one of his numerous Twitter accounts designed to harass. I am sorry you are here for this reason, and would much prefer meeting under different circumstances. However, things are what they are, let me educate you about Owen, and myself along the way to hopefully alleviate some of your concerns about me.</p>

<h3>Who is Owen?</h3>
<p>He is just another of the API pundits in the space. He's been around for a number of years. He is actually quite smart and knowledgeable about APIs, but sadly he struggles with mental illness like many of us do, but instead of seeking assistance with his struggle he chooses to live alone and lash out at people online in forums, and on social media.</p>

<h3>My Owen Timeline</h3>
<p>I have personally known Owen since 2014, although I only met him in person in 2019. I used to work quite hard to help him out and be his friend, but in 2017 after I saw how dangerous he can be harassing another fellow evangelist, I changed my tune. Here is a quick timeline of my exposure to Owen Rubels:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>2014</strong> - I was first introduced to Owen through colleagues who were concerned about him threatening to commit suicide on an API forum over a argument he got in about APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>2015</strong> - I let Owen guest post on API Evangelist to try and help boost his self image in the space and feel better about himself.</li>
  <li><strong>2016</strong> - I was asked to assist in the application of code of conduct as part of an API conference he had become a problem at through his harassment of attendee.</li>
  <li><strong>2016</strong> - I provided assistance to a male individual who Owen was harassing on and offline, and trying to get fired at the API service provider he worked with.</li>
  <li><strong>2017</strong> - I provide assistance to a female individual who Owen was harassing on and offline, and trying to get fired at the API service provider company she worked for.</li>
  <li><strong>2018</strong> - After helping my female friend, and confronting Owen about his harassment and dangerous behavior, I became the target of his harrassment.</li>
  <li><strong>2019</strong> - Owen approached me at API World in Santa Clara, and I said I would not talk to him, and asked him to leave. When I left there was a police officer outside who said Owen said I had threatened him. Luckily I had a witness with me, and one of the previous people he had harassed to counter his claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2019 Owen has harassed me online, doing background checks on me, posting blog posts, creating Twitter rants to convince people I am a violent felon, wife abuser, deadbeat dad, liar, incompetent technologist, and most recently a white supremacist.</p>

<h3>Why Post this Page?</h3>
<p>I spend upwards of 2-3 hours a week for the last two years reporting and deleting comments from Owen, and explaining to new waves of individuals why I am not what Owen claims. It has been getting worse and many, including Owen point to my silence as an admission of guilt. No more, I will continue to take this head on.</p>

<h3>An I a Violent Felon?</h3>
<p>No. I have a misdemeanor for marijuana possession in my early 20s. I am now 49. I have traveled the world for the last decade speaking about APIs. Felons do not have passports.</p>

<h3>Was I an Abuse Husband?</h3>
<p>No. I will happily put you in touch with my ex-wife. While we don't see eye to eye on many things, she'll confidently tell you I was never physically or verbally abusive towards her.</p>

<h3>Am I a Deadbeat Dad?</h3>
<p>No. I have been in my only child's life the entire time. They have lived with me throughout the pandemic. What Owen found was that I got behind on my child support and it took some time to catch-up, and my child is of adult age, and my financial obligation has long been satisfied.</p>

<h3>Am I a White Supremacist?</h3>
<p>No. I have written much about growing up in a white supremacist community, but this was just with white people who were fearful of people of color. Owen has cherry picked a couple sentences and conflated with another arrest for mistaken identity, and deemed me as a white supremacist. I am actively anti-racist, worked for the Obama administration, and happily live in Oakland, CA, and will continue to advocate that Black Lives Matter!!</p>
<h3>What I Arrested as Part of Oklahoma City Bombings?</h3>
<p>I was swept up a series of arrests after the Oklahoma City Bombings. I was held for two weeks and then let go. It had nothing to do with me. The person that Owen links me to happens to share a last name with me. That is it. He is so far off base with his detective work on this it would be laughable if he wasn't so dangerous.</p>

<h3>Was I Fired From Presidential Innovation Fellows?</h3>
<p>No. He makes the claim that PIFs make 140K, where in 2013 we made 90K, and he omits the little fact that there was a month long shutdown where we didn't get paid in 2013 -- I did not have credit cards and do not have family support. My girlfiend and I just couldn't manage to stay in DC, and I opted for paid work in the private sector, but he also omits that I have very publicly continue my work as a PIF for multiple agencies until this day.</p>

<h3>What Does this Have to Do Today?</h3>
<p>Nothing. In my youth I struggled with drugs, and had a handful of run-ins with the law, but the final arrest by the FBI scared me straight, and I've been hardworking and upstanding ever since. Poking at your past is part of Owen's toolbox and something he has done to others, but since I am not ashamed of my past, and very proud of who I am today, his tactic is less effective.</p>

<h3>Why Don't I Respond to Owen's Attacks?</h3>
<p>If I respond to Owen's individual posts it makes them inadmissable in court. I am documenting everything. Plus, I am. I respond here on my blog and on Twitter indirectly. If you notice his latest blog is a collage of my responses over the last two years. All the ammo he thinks he has I have given to him in response to whatever his crazy rant about me that month is. I am just taking this up a notch with this dedicated page.</p>

<h3>Am I Not Worried About Legal Action from Owen?</h3>
<p>No. I have learned through the legal fights of two others against Owen, as well as my regular counsel with my lawyers that Owen can say anything he wants about me online as long as he doesn't threaten me. He can email and message anyone he wants and say bad things about me. There is nothing I can do. I am just using this same reality to expose Owen for what he is. The only difference is I am not harassing others and using social media, and I will take this page down if he stops harassing everyone and goes away, or proves to me he is back on his medication.</p>

<h3>Do I Feel Unsafe?</h3>
<p>Yes. Owen showing up in person and calling the police on me makes me fearful. Watching him show up and harass others at events, and park outside their house proves this is more than online harassment. I do not want others to experience the same treatment.</p>

<h3>What Should You Do If He Harasses You?</h3>
<p>If Owen harasses you--do not engage. Do not argue with him. Do not feel bad for him. Report and block him. The only reason I am his target is because I tried to engage and help him, and assist others. If you feel comfortable, feel free to screen shot any harassment and email to me at kinlane@gmail.com and I will compile with the other history I have from my engagements, as well as the legal battles of others. If you are looking to enter in a legal challenge with Owen, please reach out, as there is a well documented history of his harassment, including successful harassment charges.</p>

<h3>Keeping this About Me</h3>
<p>Hopefully that helps you understand a little more about me now. While it grinds on me to have to see Owen slander me online daily, and it takes time to document every action he takes, I am thankful that he is focused on me and not on you. It is exhausting on good days, and emotionally debilitating on bad ones. But I am not going to let him win. I have a good reputation in the space, and people know I do what I do to make things better. Many people also know about Owen. I will not stop until he goes away.</p>
<p>Owen keeps updating his latest story by cherry picking comments I make here and on Twitter. Saying that my "therapy" posts here on the blog aren't real because people only do this in private. So not true. Writing here and API Evangelist has meant so much to my own therapy, and I have an inbox of emails from other folks who thank me for my public writing. It is too bad Owen doesn't realize the healing power of storytelling, and updating this page gives me back a little bit of power in all of this.</p>

<h3>What is Next?</h3>
<p>I am working on publishing the archive of his harassment as a detailed timeline here. I have unblocked Owen so that I can better document every action he takes. I have gotten criticism from people for not responding when I don't even see things cause I have him blocked. I have opted to unblock and document 100% activity, and then ultimately make it public. If I am going to be lightening rod here, let's do it properly and make sure folks know this isn't just about me and there is a continued pattern of harassment coming from Owen.</p>
